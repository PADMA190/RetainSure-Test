# CHANGES.md

## Major Issues Identified

- **No Web UI:** The original reference implementation did not include a frontend UI.
- **No CORS Handling:** The backend did not handle CORS, preventing frontend-backend communication.
- **No Automated Tests:** No tests for critical endpoints (recommendation for future work).
- **Minimal Error Handling:** Error messages and status codes were not always clear or consistent.
- **No Persistent Storage:** All data is in-memory (acceptable for assignment, but not production).

## Changes Made

### Backend
- **Project Structure:**
  - Migrated backend from Python Flask to Node.js with Express for modern JS stack and easier frontend integration.
- **Endpoints:**
  - Implemented `POST /api/shorten` for URL shortening.
  - Implemented `GET /:short_code` for redirection.
  - Implemented `GET /api/stats/:short_code` for analytics.
- **Validation:**
  - URLs are validated before shortening.
- **CORS:**
  - Added CORS middleware to allow frontend-backend communication.
- **Error Handling:**
  - All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes and JSON error messages.
- **Short Code Generation:**
  - Generates unique 6-character alphanumeric codes.
- **Click Tracking:**
  - Each redirect increments a click count for analytics.

### Frontend
- **UI Implementation:**
  - Built a modern React frontend using Ant Design (antd) for a clean, user-friendly experience.
  - Features:
    - URL input and shortening
    - Short URL display with copy-to-clipboard (now copies only the URL string)
    - Stats lookup and analytics display
    - Error handling and loading states
- **UI/UX Improvements:**
  - Centered card layout, improved spacing, and visual hierarchy.
  - Polished look with gradients and Ant Design components.

## Architectural Decisions
- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Backend and frontend are fully decoupled for maintainability and scalability.
- **In-Memory Storage:**
  - Used for simplicity and assignment requirements; not suitable for production.
- **Consistent API Responses:**
  - All endpoints return JSON with clear `error` or data fields.

## Trade-offs
- **No Persistent Storage:**
  - All data is lost on server restart; for demo/assignment only.
- **No Automated Tests Yet:**
  - Tests are recommended but not included due to time constraints.
- **No Rate Limiting or Auth:**
  - Not implemented, but recommended for production.

## What I'd Do With More Time
- Add automated tests for all endpoints (Jest or Mocha).
- Add persistent storage (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB).
- Add rate limiting and brute-force protection.
- Add user authentication and roles (if required).
- Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
- Add more robust logging and monitoring.

**This refactor makes the codebase modern, maintainable, and user-friendly, while preserving all original functionality and improving the user experience.**
