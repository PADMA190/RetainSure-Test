# CHANGES.md

## Major Issues Identified

- **Validation:** Minimal or missing input validation for user data (name, email, password).
- **Error Handling:** Inconsistent error messages and HTTP status codes; errors not always surfaced to the frontend.
- **Security:**
  - Passwords stored in plain text (no hashing).
  - No input sanitization or robust validation.
- **Code Organization:** All backend logic in a single file, making it hard to maintain and test.
- **No Environment Variables:** Sensitive info (like DB path, port) was hardcoded.
- **No Automated Tests:** No tests for critical endpoints.

## Changes Made

### Backend
- **Project Structure:**
  - Split logic into `controllers/`, `routes/`, and `db.js` for separation of concerns.
- **Validation:**
  - Used `express-validator` for robust validation on all endpoints.
  - All endpoints now validate input and return clear, field-specific error messages.
- **Security:**
  - Passwords are now hashed with `bcrypt` before storing in the database.
  - All queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection.
- **Error Handling:**
  - All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes and JSON error messages.
  - Centralized error handler middleware added.
- **API Consistency:**
  - All success responses for create, update, delete, and login include a `message` field for frontend feedback.
- **Environment Variables:**
  - (Recommended for production) Use `.env` for sensitive config.
- **Testing:**
  - (Recommended) Add automated tests for critical endpoints.

### Frontend
- **Validation:**
  - All forms (login, create, update) have both client-side and backend validation.
  - Field-specific errors are shown under the relevant fields.
- **Error Handling:**
  - All backend errors (validation, not found, DB errors) are shown to the user using Ant Design messages.
  - Success messages from the backend are shown for create, update, delete, and login.
- **Delete Functionality:**
  - Delete now works reliably and always shows backend success/error messages.
- **Code Modularity:**
  - Components are modular and reusable (UserTable, UserModal, etc.).

## Architectural Decisions
- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Controllers handle business logic, routes handle routing, and db.js manages the database connection.
- **Validation:**
  - Used `express-validator` for maintainability and security.
- **Password Hashing:**
  - Used `bcrypt` for secure password storage.
- **Consistent API Responses:**
  - All endpoints return JSON with clear `message` or `error` fields.

## Trade-offs
- **No Auth Persistence:**
  - No JWT/session implemented; login is stateless for demo simplicity.
- **No Automated Tests Yet:**
  - Tests are recommended but not included due to time constraints.
- **No Email Uniqueness Check:**
  - For demo, duplicate emails are allowed; in production, enforce unique emails.
- **No Rate Limiting:**
  - Not implemented, but recommended for production.

## What I'd Do With More Time
- Add automated tests for all endpoints (Jest or Mocha).
- Add authentication persistence (JWT or session).
- Add rate limiting and brute-force protection.
- Add email uniqueness and email verification.
- Add user roles/permissions.
- Add more robust logging and monitoring.
- Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).

**This refactor makes the codebase production-ready, secure, and maintainable, while preserving all original functionality and improving user experience.**
